useful commands:

clone the whole directory:
git clone https://github.com/LHHZ/RecH


add a file:
git add -f FILENAME

commit changes locally (history remembered on your local computer):
git commit -a -m 'changes are ...'

commit local changes for a single file:
git commit FILENAME -m 'changes are ...'

push your local commit to the remote repository:
git push origin master

pull changes from the remote repository:
git pull origin master

In case of conflict, you can use:

manually merge a conflict file:
copy FILENAME FILENAME_local_copy
git checkout FILENAME
git pull origin master
[then manually merge FILENAME_local_copy with FILENAME]


discard ALL local changes (save all changes into 'stash' and revert to the last git-pulled copy)
git stash save --keep-index
git pull origin master
[in this way you 'lose' all local changes (you still can get them back though)]

Tips:
Always git pull before you edit a file, and git push when you're done.
